Hey,

<%= @shared_folder.user.name %> has shared the "<%= @shared_folder.folder.name %>" folder on ShareBox.

Message from <%= @shared_folder.user.name %>:
"<%= @shared_folder.message %>"

You can now login at <%= new_user_session_url %> and view the folder if you have an account already. If you don't have one, you can sign up now at <%= new_user_registration_url %>

Love and rainbows,

ShareBox
